#### This project was done as part of a challenge for applying to an internship with a tech company specializing in Customer Relationship Management(CRM) AI solutions.


The given data has a lot of questions with unique question IDs and about 3-5 options for every question. 
Every question has one or more answer labelled as correct.

My intution was that at a CRM firm we would be able to collect similar content from customer complaint or assistance tickets. 

In the first notebook shared in this repository I build a Chatbot using the given data(using TF-IDF embeddings).
In the second notebook I cluster together similar queries using topic modelling, the intuition being that such clusters would help identify specific areas of the business that needed attention.
